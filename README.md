friendship package with mongo that will allow you to accept friend requests - they you can swipe left and swipe right. look into this because if you both like each other you want to be able to match. Both people have to want to do it before you can actually communicate.
/me isn't going to work on this project - / user/id - you'll be on your page if the id matches the token.

- sit down find out what happened
- do some coding
- user profile
